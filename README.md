# About #
We created this site for the same reason we use it. We got tired of not remembering what we already owned. We would get to a fishing supply or boating supply store and totally forget what we already owned when looking at the glorious selection of store inventory.

So to be able to keep our selection of tackle fresh, we needed a way to allow us to remember what we already had so we could spend our fishing and boating budget in a more responsible way.

So, fisherman and boaters, we suggest you use our site, not only to save money but to save your brain power for fishing and boating rather than having to remember what you own.

Can we really have too much boating and fishing supplies?

No. BUT, now we can atleast know which colors of the rainbow we already have so we can get that full lure color collection we have ALWAYS wanted.
