# Fishing Tackle Tracker #

Fishing tackle tracking app that allows users to keep track of their fishing and boating supplies.

# About Project #
This is my first attempt at using and understanding Rails, Ruby and MVC. With Rails being my first web framework.

# The Bad #
Please don't judge me by my personal projects. I did not do much for testing, I had a hard enough time trying to teach myself Rails, Ruby, Web development, Heroku, and Git at the same time. I do enjoy unit testing! My co-workers (former and current) can attest to this fact.
