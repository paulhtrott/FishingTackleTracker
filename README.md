# Fishing Tackle Tracker #

Fishing tackle tracking app that allows users to keep track of their fishing and boating supplies.

# About Project #

This is my first attempt at using and understanding Rails, Ruby and MVC. With Rails being my first web framework.

# The Bad #

Please don't judge me by my personal projects. I did not do much for testing, I had a hard enough time trying to teach myself Rails, Ruby, Web development, Bitbucket, Heroku, and Git at the same time.

# My Truth #

I do enjoy unit testing! My co-workers (former and current) can attest to this :) I also think the code is somewhat ugly. But I created this app for my brother and myself and we have not run into any issues when using the app for our personal fishing tackle.

# The Future #

Eventually I want to rewrite this app for iOS, but that's for the future, when I have time to teach myself Swift and iOS....will the future ever happen...who knows.
